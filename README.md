# ZenBlock Tomagotchi

### Why Play?

Zenblock was created for individuals who want the experience of owning their own pet without all the hassle. It is an interactive game focused on the health and wellbeing of the user and pet! 

### User Story

As the maker of Zen Block Tomagotchi, I wanted to create an application for individuals who suffer from anxiety and depression. This game allows for users to interact with a pet Tomagotchi. Allowing for a sense of connection through positive reinforcement and growth. 

This is not just a one-way street application. Zen Block Tomagotchi will also remind its' user to eat, sleep, play, and meditate. This allows for a full circle user experience and will help individuals in their day-to-day living habits so that they can stay balanced and healthy! This application has a lot of potential to help health care providers track the mental health states of there patients without doctor visits. Ultimitely, I would like to fix up this project and pitch it to medical professionals. 

### Approach Taken

I wanted there to be a modern application for my Tomagotchi. For this idea I instilled my meditation/yoga background to create a health and wellness game. I had one design approach "keep it simple". I started with the functionality. I knew I needed a start button, timer, and Tomagotchi. I simply expanded from there adding the methods for my instatiated ZenBlock. After I had my metrics and buttons working with the timer, I started to invest in my CSS. Here I knew I wanted to keep my design mostly black and white with minimal animations. The only hint of color would be in the background photo. Once I felt comfortably with my CSS, I went back to my Javascript and HTML and added the Zen-Mode button with black background functionality when clicked. I also found my GIPHYs that would be my Zen-Block animations. I added the functionality of "morphing" or changing animations as the countdown timer hit zero and the ZenBlock grew in age. My last minute adds were the prompts to the onclick functions for the metrics and some word animation when the ZenBlock is generated.
